                    i was a kid who wanted to became a youtuber and i was so must serious about it all. I was just a
                    little punk who knows nothing about the world, i mean i was in 2nd standard that time. Although
                    after i was in 7th then i started a YouTube channel i mean this channel "Tech Gamer" at first i was
                    not having any support and i didn’t even do anything like a professional because I do all of that
                    secretly without tell my parents but i thought that it would be best if i tell them because then if
                    they give me some support then i would be able to add my voice in my content and i tell them all so
                    they first think about it and they said yes. so i was too much happy and i try to make a video that
                    “why i was not uploading a single video on YouTube” which didn’t get any response but i still
                    uploaded and my first YouTube shorts got viral and i got 60 sub i was too much happy and then I
                    played a game named "Cyber Fighter" after that i played a game named "Raging Thunder 2" and now
                    "Granny" but, this game granny come in use because it got 250+ views and a new subscribers and a
                    comment the guy who commented on my video was also a youtuber and his channel was 1.6k subscribers
                    so i was too much happy and i was not happy a person with 1.6k commented on my video but i was happy
                    because my video got attention of a person .After that thought that I should use my knowledge for
                    the people because not all game which play will be available on play store so I thought that other
                    people also should get a chance to play that game which I play without spending any money so I just
                    learned web developing with help of YouTube and the channels’ name from which I learn web developing
                    was “codewithharry” if you interested to learn it then check out his channel. So yea if you wanna
                    see happy please comment on video anything you like and loved in my video or you think that i should
                    improve in that following video or content. Here down is my bio.
